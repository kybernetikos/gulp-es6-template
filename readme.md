es6-gulp
========

An experiment to see if I can use es6.

Requirements
------------

 * Ability to write npm modules usable in node
 * Must be able to write web apps
 * Easy testing, both in node and in the browser
 * I like stylus and markdown
 * Should generate jsdoc

Limitations
-----------

 * can't seem to jsdoc es6 code
 * bad code can kill the server, need a nice report instead
 * bit slower than I'd like
 * need to add styles for code blocks in markdown
